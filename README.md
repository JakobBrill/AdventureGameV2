I am currently in my first semester of studying AI. I havenâ€™t programmed before, so this is the first big project I have worked on. The logic behind it is entirely my own, but ChatGPT wrote the story and the item descriptions. Hopefully, you will still enjoy it! If you have any feedback or other ideas for things I could do as a beginner, please let me know :)
